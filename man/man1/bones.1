.Nm bones install
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm bones
is a utility that can clone, update and install skeletons derived
from a git repsoitory. It is inspired by a similar concept from
UNIX operating systems â€” where a skeleton directory can serve as
the basis for a new user's ${HOME} directory.
.sp
Most commands in bones are delegated to the '\_bones' user
via the doas(1) utility. The user running a command
that is delegated to the '\_bones' user must be a member
of the '\_bones' group. The /home/_bones directory is where
skeletons are stored, and only a superuser or a member of
the '\_bones' group can access them.
